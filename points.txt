first ,
i will start  out from the container 

in there we make everything 
center using 
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

and we combine  
  flex-wrap: wrap;
wrap says ,
    The flex items break into multiple lines. The cross-start is either equivalent to start or before depending flex-direction value and the cross-end is the opposite of the specified cross-start.

just to revise , 
there is  total three values of flex-wrap ,
flex-wrap: nowrap;
flex-wrap: wrap;
flex-wrap: wrap-reverse;

amd the nowwrap property is set by default .

then for the card we will add,
  gap: 80px;
as  It specifically sets the gap or spacing between grid or flexbox items in the horizontal and vertical directions.

In the case of grid layout, it sets the gap both horizontally and vertically between grid items.
In the case of flexbox, it sets the gap between flex items along the main axis and cross-axis.

and now we will do the card ,
with 
  border-radius: 20px;
for our design,
  border-top-left-radius: 70px;
and in order to prevent anything to cross the border , we will do 
  overflow: hidden;

and now we will make setup  for the design of the icon ,
with icon, 
which will have the initial  heigth and width ,
  width: 140px;
  height: 140px;
and to make right rounded we will do ,
  border-bottom-right-radius: 50%;

but  as we know the overflow is hidden so the yop left border is not seen

and when we hover ,
  width: 100%;

now we will design the iconbox 
which will constatn  throughtout  
the hoover effect  
with 
  position: absolute;
  inset: 10px;
  background: #282828;
  border-radius: 50%;

and to make it center when hover 
we will do ,
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;

lastly for the contetn we will 
set ,

  position: absolute;
  top: 150px;
  padding: 20px;

and for the line expansopn when hover ,
when hover ,
  letter-spacing: 0.3em;
